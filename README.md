# College Unfiltered 

College Unfiltered aims to be a web app designed to allow prospective college students to search and find current students in the colleges they are interested in, so as to receive authentic, unfiltered advice on their experiences on their college campuses.

## --How it works--
Current students that sign-up have their information entered into a database, which can then be filtered according to preferences such as: major, class, interests, etc. Prospective students then use College Unfiltered to search for current students they are interested in connecting with, and can either email or Facebook message them to connect, chat, receive virtual tours, and such. 

This website is still static and in development. When fully developed, we hope this app acts as useful tool for all students in need of a more personal connection with current college students.  This includes international students unable to tour colleges in person, students of lower income brackets who want to envision their higher education plans, students who need help deciding which college to attend and more.
